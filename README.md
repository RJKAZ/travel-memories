Quick refresher on how to build and deploy a MERN App
I followed this You Tube Tutorial 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngc9gnGgUdA

left off at 18:33 of 1:15:39 of the first video

left off at 21:01 - also when resuming the tutorial, be sure to put the password back in the index.js file for mongodb.

Finished 1st video - the App Works but the Mongo Atlas won't recieve the data, I think I messed that up with the database name in the connection url in index.js file in the server side. 

Rewatch the 1st video, the part of setting up the Mongo Atlas connection and fix the problem

then commence with Video 2

left off on the 2nd video at the 11:26 mark. Double check all the code...from the end of the first video to this part, something is wrong

the background image was taken from this really cool site - look into this site more after the project is complete

left off on 2nd video at 23:43 mark. at this point the server isn't working. 

left off on the 2nd video at the 28:00 mark - server is still not working and I'm not sure why. I have been trouble shooting for over an hour now. 

ok, thats weird....it won't work on my zbook, but on my desktop the server starts up fine.?


alright, left at the 2nd video at the 51:20 mark. All teh base functionality works fine, but likes and updateing require a manual refresh of the page to take effect. I messed that up somewhere.
