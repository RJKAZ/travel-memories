Quick refresher on how to build and deploy a MERN App
I followed this You Tube Tutorial 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngc9gnGgUdA

left off at 18:33 of 1:15:39 of the first video

left off at 21:01 - also when resuming the tutorial, be sure to put the password back in the index.js file for mongodb.

Finished 1st video - the App Works but the Mongo Atlas won't recieve the data, I think I messed that up with the database name in the connection url in index.js file in the server side. 

Rewatch the 1st video, the part of setting up the Mongo Atlas connection and fix the problem

then commence with Video 2
